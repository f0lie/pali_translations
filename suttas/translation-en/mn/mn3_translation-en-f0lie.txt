The Discourse on Heirs of the Dhamma [E 0.2]

Evaṁ me sutaṁ— [1.1]
Thus have I heard. [E 1.1]

ekaṁ samayaṁ bhagavā sāvatthiyaṁ viharati jetavane anāthapiṇḍikassa ārāme. [1.2]
At one time the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's monastery. [E 1.2]

Tatra kho bhagavā bhikkhū āmantesi: [1.3]
There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: [E 1.3]

“bhikkhavo”ti. [1.4]
"Bhikkhus!" [E 1.4]

“Bhadante”ti te bhikkhū bhagavato paccassosuṁ. [1.5]
"Venerable Sir," those bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One. [E 1.5]

Bhagavā etadavoca: [1.6]
The Blessed One said this: [E 1.6]

“Dhammadāyādā me, bhikkhave, bhavatha, mā āmisadāyādā. [2.1]
"Be heirs of the Dhamma, bhikkhus, not heirs of material things. [E 2.1]

Atthi me tumhesu anukampā: [2.2]
There is compassion in me for you: [E 2.2]

‘kinti me sāvakā dhammadāyādā bhaveyyuṁ, no āmisadāyādā’ti. [2.3]
'How can my disciples be heirs of the Dhamma, not heirs of material things?' [E 2.3]

Tumhe ca me, bhikkhave, āmisadāyādā bhaveyyātha no dhammadāyādā, tumhepi tena ādiyā bhaveyyātha: [2.4]
If you, bhikkhus, were to be heirs of material things and not heirs of the Dhamma, you would be liable to reproach: [E 2.4]
"Ca me" is a PLI phrase where "ca" is a conjunction meaning "and" or "also," used for emphasis, and "me" is a dative pronoun meaning "to me" or "for me," but in this context signifies the Buddha's concern for his disciples. The Buddha uses this phrase to emphasize his instruction within the teacher-student dynamic, conveying both his authority and his benevolent concern for their spiritual progress.] [C 2.4]

‘āmisadāyādā satthusāvakā viharanti, no dhammadāyādā’ti; [2.5]
'The Teacher's disciples live as heirs of material things, not as heirs of the Dhamma'; [E 2.5]

ahampi tena ādiyo bhaveyyaṁ: [2.6]
I too would be liable to reproach: [E 2.6]

‘āmisadāyādā satthusāvakā viharanti, no dhammadāyādā’ti. [2.7]
'The Teacher's disciples live as heirs of material things, not as heirs of the Dhamma.' [E 2.7]

Tumhe ca me, bhikkhave, dhammadāyādā bhaveyyātha, no āmisadāyādā, tumhepi tena na ādiyā bhaveyyātha: [2.8]
And you, bhikkhus, should be heirs of the Dhamma, not heirs of material things. You too would not be liable to reproach: [E 2.8]

‘dhammadāyādā satthusāvakā viharanti, no āmisadāyādā’ti; [2.9]
'The Teacher's disciples live as heirs of the Dhamma, not as heirs of material things'; [E 2.9]

ahampi tena na ādiyo bhaveyyaṁ: [2.10]
nor would I be liable to reproach: [E 2.10]

‘dhammadāyādā satthusāvakā viharanti, no āmisadāyādā’ti. [2.11]
'The Teacher's disciples live as heirs of the Dhamma, not as heirs of material things.' [E 2.11]

Tasmātiha me, bhikkhave, dhammadāyādā bhavatha, mā āmisadāyādā. [2.12]
Therefore, bhikkhus, be heirs of the Dhamma, not heirs of material things. [E 2.12]

Atthi me tumhesu anukampā: [2.13]
There is compassion in me for you: [E 2.13]

‘kinti me sāvakā dhammadāyādā bhaveyyuṁ, no āmisadāyādā’ti. [2.14]
'How can my disciples be heirs of the Dhamma, not heirs of material things?'" [E 2.14]

Idhāhaṁ, bhikkhave, bhuttāvī assaṁ pavārito paripuṇṇo pariyosito suhito yāvadattho; [3.1]
Here, bhikkhus, I suppose I have eaten, satisfied, full, done, content, and having had enough; [E 3.1]
It might odd that the Buddha uses five different words to describe eating. But if one were to pay attention while eating, one often eats beyond being full and what the stomach can handle. [C 3.1]

siyā ca me piṇḍapāto atirekadhammo chaḍḍanīyadhammo. [3.2]
and there is my leftover alms-food that should be discarded. [E 3.2]

Atha dve bhikkhū āgaccheyyuṁ jighacchādubbalyaparetā. [3.3]
Then two bhikkhus come, overcome by hunger and weakness. [E 3.3]

Tyāhaṁ evaṁ vadeyyaṁ: [3.4]
Then I would say to them: [E 3.4]

‘ahaṁ khomhi, bhikkhave, bhuttāvī pavārito paripuṇṇo pariyosito suhito yāvadattho; [3.5]
"bhikkhus, I have eaten, satisfied, full, done, content, and having had enough; [E 3.5]

atthi ca me ayaṁ piṇḍapāto atirekadhammo chaḍḍanīyadhammo. [3.6]
and there is my leftover alms-food that should be discarded. [E 3.6]

Sace ākaṅkhatha, bhuñjatha, no ce tumhe bhuñjissatha, idānāhaṁ appaharite vā chaḍḍessāmi, appāṇake vā udake opilāpessāmī’ti. [3.7]
If you wish, eat it; if you do not eat it, I will discard it in a barren place or pour it into water where no living beings dwell.' [E 3.7]

Tatrekassa bhikkhuno evamassa: [3.8]
Then one of the bhikkhus might think: [E 3.8]

‘bhagavā kho bhuttāvī pavārito paripuṇṇo pariyosito suhito yāvadattho; [3.9]
'The Blessed One has eaten, is satisfied, full, done, content, and having had enough; [E 3.9]

atthi cāyaṁ bhagavato piṇḍapāto atirekadhammo chaḍḍanīyadhammo. [3.10]
and there is Blessed One's leftover alms-food that should be discarded. [E 3.10]

Sace mayaṁ na bhuñjissāma, idāni bhagavā appaharite vā chaḍḍessati, appāṇake vā udake opilāpessati. [3.11]
If we do not eat it, the Blessed One will discard it in a barren place or pour it into water where no living beings dwell. [E 3.11]

Vuttaṁ kho panetaṁ bhagavatā: [3.12]
It has been said by the Blessed One: [E 3.12]

“dhammadāyādā me, bhikkhave, bhavatha, mā āmisadāyādā”ti. [3.13]
"Bhikkhus, be heirs of the Dhamma, not heirs of material things." [E 3.13]

Āmisaññataraṁ kho panetaṁ, yadidaṁ piṇḍapāto. [3.14]
And this alms-food is a material thing in particular. [E 3.14]
Starving oneself is not the purpose of the practice. The Buddha rejected this path and ate alms-food to sustain the body. But alms-food still more material than the Dhamma. Hence, the Buddha speaking about restraining here to develop the Dhamma further. [C 3.14]

Yannūnāhaṁ imaṁ piṇḍapātaṁ abhuñjitvā imināva jighacchādubbalyena evaṁ imaṁ rattindivaṁ vītināmeyyan’ti. [3.15]
What if I were to not eat this alms-food and endure the day and night with this hunger and weakness? [E 3.15]

So taṁ piṇḍapātaṁ abhuñjitvā teneva jighacchādubbalyena evaṁ taṁ rattindivaṁ vītināmeyya. [3.16]
Then, without eating that alms-food, he would endure the day and night with that hunger and weakness? [E 3.16]

Atha dutiyassa bhikkhuno evamassa: [3.17]
Then another bhikkhu might think: [E 3.17]

‘bhagavā kho bhuttāvī pavārito paripuṇṇo pariyosito suhito yāvadattho; [3.18]
'The Blessed One has eaten, is satisfied, full, done, content, and having had enough; [E 3.18]

atthi cāyaṁ bhagavato piṇḍapāto atirekadhammo chaḍḍanīyadhammo. [3.19]
and there is the Blessed One's leftover alms-food that should be discarded. [E 3.19]

Sace mayaṁ na bhuñjissāma, idāni bhagavā appaharite vā chaḍḍessati, appāṇake vā udake opilāpessati. [3.20]
If we do not eat it, the Blessed One will discard it in a barren place or pour it into water where no living beings dwell. [E 3.20]

Yannūnāhaṁ imaṁ piṇḍapātaṁ bhuñjitvā jighacchādubbalyaṁ paṭivinodetvā evaṁ imaṁ rattindivaṁ vītināmeyyan’ti. [3.21]
What if I were to eat this alms-food and then spend the day and night, having dispelled this hunger and weakness? [E 3.21]

So taṁ piṇḍapātaṁ bhuñjitvā jighacchādubbalyaṁ paṭivinodetvā evaṁ taṁ rattindivaṁ vītināmeyya. [3.22]
Then, having eaten that alms-food, he would spend the day and night having dispelled that hunger and weakness. [E 3.22]

Kiñcāpi so, bhikkhave, bhikkhu taṁ piṇḍapātaṁ bhuñjitvā jighacchādubbalyaṁ paṭivinodetvā evaṁ taṁ rattindivaṁ vītināmeyya, atha kho asuyeva me purimo bhikkhu pujjataro ca pāsaṁsataro ca. [3.23]
Even though that bhikkhu, having eaten that alms-food, would pass the day and night having dispelled that hunger and weakness, that earlier bhikkhu is still more worthy of respect and praise to me. [E 3.23]

Taṁ kissa hetu? [3.24]
And why is that? [E 3.24]

Tañhi tassa, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno dīgharattaṁ appicchatāya santuṭṭhiyā sallekhāya subharatāya vīriyārambhāya saṁvattissati. [3.25]
Because, bhikkhus, that (earlier) bhikkhu will lead to long-term fewness of wishes, contentment, erasure (of defilements), ease of support, and diligent effort. [E 3.25]

Tasmātiha me, bhikkhave, dhammadāyādā bhavatha, mā āmisadāyādā. [3.26]
Therefore, bhikkhus, be heirs of the Dhamma, not heirs of material things. [E 3.26]

Atthi me tumhesu anukampā: [3.27]
There is compassion in me for you: [E 3.27]

‘kinti me sāvakā dhammadāyādā bhaveyyuṁ, no āmisadāyādā’”ti. [3.28]
'How can my disciples be heirs of the Dhamma, not heirs of material things?' [E 3.28]

Idamavoca bhagavā. [4.1]
This is what the Blessed One said. [E 4.1]

Idaṁ vatvāna sugato uṭṭhāyāsanā vihāraṁ pāvisi. [4.2]
Having said this, the Excellent One rose from his seat and entered his dwelling. [E 4.2]

Tatra kho āyasmā sāriputto acirapakkantassa bhagavato bhikkhū āmantesi: [4.3]
Then, shortly after the Blessed One had departed, the Venerable Sāriputta addressed the bhikkhus: [E 4.3]

“āvuso bhikkhave”ti. [4.4]
"Friends, bhikkhus!" [E 4.4]

“Āvuso”ti kho te bhikkhū āyasmato sāriputtassa paccassosuṁ. [4.5]
"Friend!" those monks replied to the Venerable Sāriputta. [E 4.5]

Āyasmā sāriputto etadavoca: [4.6]
The Venerable Sāriputta said this: [E 4.6]

“Kittāvatā nu kho, āvuso, satthu pavivittassa viharato sāvakā vivekaṁ nānusikkhanti, kittāvatā ca pana satthu pavivittassa viharato sāvakā vivekamanusikkhantī”ti? [5.1]
"How, friend, do the disciples not train in withdrawal while the teacher lives withdrawn, and how do the disciples train in withdrawal while the teacher lives withdrawn?" [E 5.1]
I rendered "viveka" as "withdrawn" rather than "secluded" because one isn't just physically being separated, but mentally being withdrawn from the unwholesome. [C 5.1]

“Dūratopi kho mayaṁ, āvuso, āgacchāma āyasmato sāriputtassa santike etassa bhāsitassa atthamaññātuṁ. [5.2]
"Even from afar, friend, we would come to the Venerable Sāriputta to understand the meaning of this statement." [E 5.2]

Sādhu vatāyasmantaṁyeva sāriputtaṁ paṭibhātu etassa bhāsitassa attho; [5.3]
"It would be good if the meaning of this statement were explained by the Venerable Sāriputta himself." [E 5.3]

āyasmato sāriputtassa sutvā bhikkhū dhāressantī”ti. [5.4]
"The bhikkhus will retain what they heard from the Venerable Sāriputta." [E 5.4]

“Tena hāvuso, suṇātha, sādhukaṁ manasi karotha, bhāsissāmī”ti. [5.5]
"Then, friends, listen and apply the mind well, and I will speak." [E 5.5]
"Apply the mind well" is not just paying close attention, but reflecting more deeply and thoroughly about what is being said. [C 5.5]

“Evamāvuso”ti kho te bhikkhū āyasmato sāriputtassa paccassosuṁ. [5.6]
"Yes, friend," those monks replied to the Venerable Sāriputta. [E 5.6]

Āyasmā sāriputto etadavoca: [5.7]
The Venerable Sāriputta said this: [E 5.7]

“Kittāvatā nu kho, āvuso, satthu pavivittassa viharato sāvakā vivekaṁ nānusikkhanti? [6.1]

Idhāvuso, satthu pavivittassa viharato sāvakā vivekaṁ nānusikkhanti, [6.2]
