# Pali Translation

I am trying to learn Pali and I using ChatGPT/Gemini to translate the Pali and look up the dictionary meaning of the words.

I am storing the results of that process as well as adding comments.

File format conventions and Pali suttas were taken from [hh-suttas](https://github.com/bkhpanigha/hh-suttas/tree/main/suttas) which took their file and Pali from [bilara-data](https://github.com/suttacentral/bilara-data/tree/published)

I did not use Bilara because this purpose of this project is for personal learning of Pali and Bilara is setup for publishing on suttacentral.com.
